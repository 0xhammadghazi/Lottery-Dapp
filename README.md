# Lottery Dapp

* [Lottery Dapp](http://lottery-dapp.surge.sh/) is a decentralized application, built over Ethereum blockchain. The frontend of the lottery dapp is built using React.
* Lottery dapp smart contract is using Chainlink VRF to generate random number and Chainlink Alarm Clock to pick a winner at a given time.

## Important Information:
* Install the metamask plugin or use a Wallet-enabled browser such as Brave and authenticate the transaction so as to enter the lottery.
* Create an account on Kovan Test Network in order to interact with the Lottery Dapp.
* Winner will be picked, everyday at 2:20 AM (Pakistan Standard Time).
* If Chainlink's Alarm Clock Node of Kovan Network is down, then the smart contract will not work as intended!
